        <summary>Lab report writing tool for students.</summary>
        <description format="text/html">This package is a lab report writing tool for students.  It depends on the lab report templates created by lab instructors in Lab Report Central.  Lab Report Central is a centralised place for creating lab report templates.  The Lab Report package is the student's space for writing their reports for specific labs, based on the templates in Lab Report Central.  Separating this into two packages allows for the Lab Report package to be mounted at several subsites, as would be the case if it were to be integrated into dotFOLIO.</description>
